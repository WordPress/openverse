In adherence to ###wpCoc### and its ###deiStatement###, ###openverse### holds contributors to high expectations regarding conduct towards other contributors, the accessibility of contribution and the services, and, therefore, being an inclusive project. Similarly, ###openverse### holds the expectation that the results returned from the API or displayed on the ###openverse###.org website should be accessible by default.
