# Project boards

Openverse project management consists of four project boards,
[one for issues](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/75),
[one for PRs](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/98),
[one for project threads](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/70) and
[one for discussions](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/79).

Issues and PRs are added to these boards and move across columns based on their
status. Automations to move these cards can be broadly classified into two
types:

- automations built into the GitHub Projects UI
- custom automations run as GitHub Actions workflows

Read on to know more about these boards and the automations that apply to them.
