# Initialises all automations related to PR events.
#
# See `issue_automations.yml` for the corresponding implementation for issues.
#
# The automations for PR events are a little more complex than those for issues
# because PRs are a less secure environment. To avoid leaking secrets, we need
# to run automations with code as it appears on `main`.
#
# `pull_request_target` serves this purpose but there is no corresponding
# `_target` version for `pull_request_review`. So we take this roundabout
# approach:
#
# 1. This workflow runs for the events and their subtypes we are interested in.
# 2. It saves the event payload to a JSON file and the event name and action to
#    an environment file.
# 3. It uploads the JSON file and the environment files as artifacts.
#
# continued in `pr_automations.yml`...
