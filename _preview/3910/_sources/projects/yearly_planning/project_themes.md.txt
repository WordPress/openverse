# Project Themes

The Openverse project is vast and multifaceted! When forming ideas for projects,
it can be useful to have some guiding themes & categories that projects might
fall into. The establishment of these themes can be a step that's done
collectively at the beginning of the yearly planning process, but it doesn't
have to be done every year. The themes themselves have remained somewhat
consistent over the years, even if the wording for certain themes has changed.

Below are the project themes which were established by the maintainers for 2024:

- **Improve Search Relevancy**
- **Refine Search Experience**
- **Make Openverse Safer to Use & Maintain**
- **Broaden our Data**
- **Progress Service & Code Resiliency**
- **Engage the Community**
- **Enable Integrations**

Projects for each year are
[categorized by theme in our project tracker](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/70/views/7).
