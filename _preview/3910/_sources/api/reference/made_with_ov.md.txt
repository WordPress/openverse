# Made with Openverse

The Openverse API provides access to the world's largest library of
openly-licensed creative works, containing over 700 million images and audio
tracks. All Openverse content is under a
[Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) or is in the
public domain.

```{caution}
Openverse cannot make any claims about the accuracy of license information. You
should always verify the license of a particular work before using it.

As a developer, you can use the Openverse API to create incredible apps. Here
are some apps powered by the Openverse API.
