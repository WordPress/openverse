# Analytics

Openverse uses Plausible for analytics. This document describes how to set up
and use the Openverse Plausible integration. It is not necessary to set up
Plausible for general frontend development unless specifically working on custom
events.

Running Plausible locally requires Docker and docker-compose.

## Plausible set up and first run

Use the following `just` recipes to set Plausible up locally:

```sh
# Runs the portion of the docker-compose stack that includes Plausible
just frontend/up

# Sets up Plausible with a default user and the localhost testing site
# Only necessary the first time you run Plausible locally, when adding
# new custom events, or any time after you run `just down -v`
just frontend/init
```

If you have already run `just up` and `just init` at the root of the repository,
then Plausible is already set up and running the commands above is not
necessary.

> **Note**
>
> `just frontend/up` may take some time on first run as it will need to download
> various docker images required for the Plausible stack.

## Access Plausible

Plausible is accessible at <http://0.0.0.0:50288>. The default localhost
username and password are:

- Username: `deploy@example.com`
- Password: `deploy`

Our setup script will have already added the "localhost" site used for testing
the Plausible integration on a locally running Openverse frontend. Refer to
[the frontend quickstart documentation](./quickstart.md) for instructions to set
up the Openverse frontend locally.

## Custom events

Plausible supports custom events via its "goals" feature.
[Plausible's documentation for this feature can be found here](https://plausible.io/docs/custom-event-goals).

Sending custom events to Plausible is done by calling the `sendCustomEvents`
function. For this function to accept a custom event name, you must update the
`Events` type in `frontend/src/types/analyticts.ts` to include the new event
name and any payload elements unique to the event.

Custom events must be added to Plausible for it to record them. You may do this
one of two ways:

- Automatically:
  1.  Run `just frontend/init`, which automatically extracts the events name
      from the `Events` type
- Manually:
  1.  Visit <http://0.0.0.0:50288/localhost/settings/goals> and click the "+ Add
      goal" button
  2.  Select the "custom event" trigger and add the custom event name in the
      text box
  3.  Click "add goal" to save the new custom event

**If you are testing custom events added by others, you must also follow this
process for them to appear in your local environment. `just frontend/init` will
be the simplest way to do so in those cases, provided the change request
includes the necessary changes to the `Events` type.**

After adding the custom event, upon receiving at least one instance of the
event, Plausible will display the event under the "Goal Conversions" section on
the stats page. It will look like this:

![Plausible "Goal Conversions" example at bottom of site stats page](./goal-conversions.png)

If you are adding a new custom event that includes unique payload elements, you
can click the custom event name in the "Goal Conversions" section to reveal the
payload elements and confirm that your payload items appear as expected.

### Sending

To send a custom event from the frontend, use the `sendCustomEvents` function
generated by the `useAnalytics` composable. For example:

```ts
import { useAnalytics } from "~/composables/use-analytics"

const { sendCustomEvent } = useAnalytics()
const handleClick = () => {
  sendCustomEvent("COOL_EVENT_NAME", {
    mediaType: props.mediaType,
  })
}
```

**You must set up the custom event following the instructions in the previous
section before this will do anything.**

### Default payload

`sendCustomEvent` will automatically include the following payload elements:

- `width`: The width of the screen in pixels at the time of the event
- `height`: The height of the screen in pixels at the time of the event
- `breakpoint`: One of the Openverse breakpoint values, for determining broad
  page layout for a given event

While these are included by default, any of them may not be present for a given
event instance if the information was not available at the time. For example,
referrer is not available if the page is visited directly.

Payload props unique to individual events may not use the same name as any of
the props listed above or they will overwrite the default props.
