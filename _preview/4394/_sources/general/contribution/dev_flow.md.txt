# Development workflow

To contribute code to Openverse, follow the following steps.

1. Complete the [general setup](/general/general_setup.md) of your development
   environment.

2. Fork the repository you want to contribute to. When you make a code change
   you will push the changes to a branch on your fork and make a PR to the
   original repo to incorporate those changes.

   Go to the repository page on GitHub and find the "Fork" button in the upper
   corner of the page. Click this and GitHub will guide you through the process
   of forking the repository.

3. Make sure to go through the [quickstart guide](/general/quickstart.md) to
   have your local environment set up and running.

4. Work on the issue you've chosen. Check out a new branch from `main`, named
   after the issue you're solving. Create commits on this branch and push to
   your fork.

5. Once you have the solution, make a PR from your working branch on your fork
   to the `main` branch on the `origin` repo. You can make a PR even before you
   have a solution, but you should mark it as a draft. That PR will
   automatically update when you create new commits on your work branch.
