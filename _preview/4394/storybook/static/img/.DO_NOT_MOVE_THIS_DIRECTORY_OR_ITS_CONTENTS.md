# DO NOT MOVE THIS DIRECTORY OR ITS CONTENTS

As the title says, don't do it üòÅ

For historical reasons (pre-Openverse, back in the CC Search days) we need to
serve these files at `/static/img/*.svg`. Nuxt serves static files at the top
level, so anything immediately inside the `src/static` directory will just be
served directly at `/` (like `/favicon.ico`). The nested `static` directories
are absolutely necessary to maintain existing static assets being served at the
root _and_ these historical static assets that need to be served at `/static`.

If you do happen to move these files you will break the references to these
glyphs in the attribution HTML copied users from single result pages throughout
the entire history of CC Search and Openverse.

Thank you for not moving or renaming these files ‚ù§Ô∏è
