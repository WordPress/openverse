# Welcome

Thank you for your interest in Openverse! We're so excited to bring new
contributors into the fold in Openverse, WordPress and FOSS in general. This
document is a set of guidelines to help you contribute to this project.

## Code of Conduct

You should read and agree to abide by the
[code of conduct](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
before contributing to WordPress projects. This applies to all Openverse
repositories because Openverse is a WordPress Foundation project.

## Keep in touch

Don't hesitate to ask for help; if you're stuck, we're here for you! You can
ping us via any of our
[communication channels](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse#keep-in-touch).

## Code and code-related contributions

### Get started

Detailed help for contributing code can be found in the
[developer documentation](https://docs.openverse.org/), which also includes the
following subfolders.

The following resources are preferred reading for starting your Openverse
contribution journey in the code and code-related space.

- [GitHub contribution practices](/meta/github_contribution_practices.md)
- [Dev flow](/meta/dev_flow.md)
- [General setup guide](/general/general_setup.md)
- [Quickstart guide](/general/quickstart.md)

#### Friendly notes

It's totally acceptable to work on more than one
["good first issue"](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:%22good+first+issue%22).

On GitHub, you can ping us on any issue you would like to work on or triaging
and on PRs that you've opened or are giving feedback on. You can ping a specific
person using their GitHub handle, or even the entire Openverse team using
`@WordPress/openverse-maintainers`.

### Text and documentation

Our documentation and copy text could always use improvement. If you spot any
scope for improvement, from the smallest punctuation error to the largest
factual inaccuracy, you can file an issue or fix an already open one.

- [Good first issues with the "üìÑ aspect: text" label](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:%22good+first+issue%22+label:%22%F0%9F%93%84+aspect:+text%22)
- [Issues wanting help with the "üìÑ aspect: text" label](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:%22help+wanted%22+label:%22%F0%9F%93%84+aspect:+text%22)

### Bug reproduction & triage

Openverse has a large list of open bugs. In many cases these bugs can be out of
date, or their reproduction criteria may no longer be accurate. It is useful
information for maintainers to know whether the issue mentioned can still be
reproduced on recent versions of the code or if the issue can no longer be
replicated.

- [Issues with the "üõ† goal: fix" label](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:%22%F0%9F%9B%A0+goal:+fix%22)

### Pull request review

New contributors are welcome and invited to provide feedback on pull requests.
You can start by just asking questions! It's great to get to know the project
and helps PR authors by uncovering unspoken or undocumented assumptions that
exist about the project. It is frequently folks who know the least about and are
newest to a project that ask the most helpful questions in this regard.

- [Non-draft open PRs](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/pulls?q=is:pr+is:open+-is:draft)

### Programming

Any issues labeled as "good first issue" or "help wanted" in our repositories
are all up for grabs. Just add a comment tagging the maintainers using
`@WordPress/openverse-maintainers` on the issue with questions or requesting the
issue be assigned to you when you're ready to work on it.

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:%22good+first+issue%22)
- [Issues wanting help](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:%22help+wanted%22)

## Non-code contributions

If programming is not your cup of tea, there are ways to contribute to Openverse
that do not involve working with code at all. Some of them are listed below.

### Design

If you'd like to contribute to the design, feel free to propose a solution to an
existing problem labeled with
[Needs Design](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+design%22),
or share an idea if you think it meets Openverse's goals.

The [WordPress Design team](http://make.wordpress.org/design/) uses
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to collaborate and share work for all WordPress
projects. If you are not familiar with designing for WordPress, please carefully
read the [design handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/). Once
you have a [WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) account, join the
[#design channel](http://wordpress.slack.com/messages/design/) and ask the team
to set you up with a free Figma account.

This will give you access to
[all projects and files](https://www.figma.com/files/team/642003996626140596/WordPress.org?fuid=968867265893371002)
used in WordPress.

Before designing a proposal, browse the
[Design Library](https://www.figma.com/file/GIIQ4sDbaToCfFQyKMvzr8/Openverse-Design-Library?node-id=0%3A1)
file to understand how Openverse has been built, and take a look at the
[created work](https://www.figma.com/files/project/31962071/Openverse?fuid=968867265893371002)
to get a glance at how design ideas are made. As the design onboarding section
in the design library file is constantly being added to and improved, some
documentation may be missing. If you have doubts, ask on
[#design channel](http://wordpress.slack.com/messages/design/) for
clarification. If you discover new information that is yet to be documented,
contributing this information back to the documentation is very much
appreciated.

Once you are done and ready to share your idea,
[create an issue with the `design` label and fill in the template](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-frontend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=üñºÔ∏è+aspect%3A+design%2C‚ú®+goal%3A+improvement%2C+üö¶+status%3A+awaiting+triage&template=feature_request.md&title=<Replace+this+with+actual+title>).
Please be as specific and concise as possible and feel free to add mockups,
prototypes, videos, sketches, and anything that makes your idea easier to
understand.

After creating the issue, it will be labeled with `aspect: design`. Please
reference
[existing design issues](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%F0%9F%96%BC%EF%B8%8F+aspect%3A+design%22)
as a guide for how to describe your solution and to understand how the
discussion evolves before implementation begins.

### Translations

You can also contribute to Openverse by translating it.

An overview of Openverse translations is here:
[https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/openverse/](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/openverse/)

A getting started guide for translating on GlotPress (the software behind
[translate.wordpress.org](http://translate.wordpress.org)) is here:
[https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/#getting-started](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/#getting-started)

### Providers

Openverse is powered by upstream providers of openly licensed media. You can
help expand Openverse by identifying sources of Creative Commons licensed
media - we're always looking to broaden our dataset.

[Our currently list of providers which have been identified but are not yet being ingested can be found here](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F+provider%3A+any%22%2C%22%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F+provider%3A+audio%22%2C%22%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F+provider%3A+images%22%2C%22%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F+provider%3A+text%22%2C%22%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F+provider%3A+video%22%2C%22%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F+provider%3A+3D+models%22).

You can use the
[New Source Suggestion for Openverse](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%9A%A6+status%3A+awaiting+triage%2C%F0%9F%A7%B9+status%3A+ticket+work+required%2C%E2%98%81%EF%B8%8F+provider%3A+any&template=new_source_suggestion.yml&title=%3CSource+name+here%3E)
issue template to submit whatever sources you find.

### Feedback

Feedback like reporting bugs and missing features is big help for Openverse. We
want Openverse to be a bug-free app with great user experience and providing
feedback is a way to put any shortcomings on our radar and get them resolved.

You can report bugs, request features and see all other forms of feedback we
would like to receive by
[submitting a new issue](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/issues/new/choose)
on GitHub. All are welcome to write issues and the Openverse maintainers have
deep gratitude for those who do. Note that you will need a GitHub account to
create new issues.

You can also provide feedback via any of our other
[communication channels](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse#keep-in-touch).

### Referrals

If you know folks who have expertise in any of the above areas who you think
might be interested in contributing to open source, send them our way! We're
happy to help onboard folks to the project itself, as well as the tools and
technologies we use.
