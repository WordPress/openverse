# Proof-of-functionality

In the CI + CD workflow, the concept of proof-of-functionality is used to
determine if the build assets of a service are fit for
[three use cases](./flow.md).

- [Docs publish](./flow.md#documentation)
- [GHCR publish](./flow.md#docker-publishing)
- [Staging deploy](./flow.md#deployment)

For different services, different tests are considered to establish
proof-of-functionality for different use-cases.

| Service          | Docs publish                                      | GHCR publish                                      | Staging deploy                                                                                |

## Rationales

### Catalog

The tests for the catalog in `test-cat` are very comprehensive and rigourous,
including extended test suites using the `--extended` flag. Passing these tests
conclusively proves that the catalog works as intended.

### Ingestion server

The ingestion server integration test in `test-ing` invokes all the key
functionality of the ingestion server. Passing these tests conclusively proves
that the ingestion server works as intended.

### API

The API tests in `test-api` include both unit tests for the API and integration
tests that explore the API's functionality. These tests also include example
tests wherein the API's output is compared to known-good output. Passing these
tests conclusively proves that the API works as intended.

### Frontend

The frontends difference between criteria for GHCR publish and staging deploy is
a controversial choice. ðŸš§ We will revise this.
