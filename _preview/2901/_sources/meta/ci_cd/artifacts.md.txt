# Artifacts

The CI + CD workflow, produces a number of artifacts that can be accessed from
the Summary page of a workflow run.

```
https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/actions/runs/<run_id>
```

These artifacts are classified into TODO types:

- Docker images
- Logs
- Documentation

## Docker images

The following artifacts are Docker images:

- `api`
- `api_nginx`
- `catalog`
- `frontend`
- `ingestion_server`
- `openverse_db`

All of these images are outputs of the
[`build-images`](/meta/ci_cd/jobs/docker.md#build-images) job. These artifacts
have little utility outside of the workflow and are primarily intended to be
consumed by other jobs that need these images, to avoid building them
repeatedly.

## Logs

The following artifacts are logs for debugging.

- `api_logs`

  This log file contains all the logs from all the Docker services written in
  the course of the API tests. This artifact is created by by the
  [`test-api`](/meta/ci_cd/jobs/api.md#test-api) job.

- `ing_logs`

  This log file contains all the logs from all the Docker services written in
  the course of the ingestion server tests. This artifact is created by the
  [`test-ing`](/meta/ci_cd/jobs/ingestion_server.md#test-ing) job.

## Documentation

The following artifacts are related to documentation.

- `openapi.json`

  This is the OpenAPI schema of the Openverse API. This JSON file is consumed by
  Redoc to generate the
  [interactive API docs](https://api.openverse.engineering/v1/). This is
  generated by the [`django-checks`](/meta/ci_cd/jobs/api.md#django-checks) job,
  specifically the `test_doc` named element in the matrix.

- `documentation`

  This is the main documentation comprising of the Sphinx site, the Storybook
  and the Tailwind Config Viewer. It's built by the
  [`build-docs`](/meta/ci_cd/jobs/documentation.md#build-docs) job and used by
  the [`emit-docs`](/meta/ci_cd/jobs/documentation.md#emit-docs) to deploy
  either as the main documentation site (if the workflow is running for a new
  commit pushed to `main`) or as a preview (if the workflow is running for a
  PR).
