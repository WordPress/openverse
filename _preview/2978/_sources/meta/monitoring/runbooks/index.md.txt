# Runbooks

This section collects runbooks for responding to Openverse infrastructure
alarms.

Please see
[the "Run Books" section of the ECS baseline monitoring implementation plan for further details on what runbooks are and their requirements](/projects/proposals/monitoring/20230606_implementation_plan_ecs_alarms.md#run-books).
The implementation plan also includes
[example runbooks](/projects/proposals/monitoring/20230606_implementation_plan_ecs_alarms.md#example-run-books)
that can be a good resource when writing a new one.
