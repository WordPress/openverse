# Deployment runbook

## Setup

1. Check
   [Airflow](https://airflow.openverse.engineering/dagrun/list/?_flt_3_state=running)
   to make sure no DAGs are running.
1. Visit the
   [Catalog Docker image](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/pkgs/container/openverse-catalog)
   page and copy the SHA of the image tagged `latest`.
1. Release the app via
   [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse/actions/workflows/release-app.yml).
   Click the "Run workflow" button, choose "catalog" from the dropdown, and
   supply the SHA identified in the previous step

## Deployment

The catalog only exists in production, so there is no staging deployment. After
the app is built and tagged, deploy production:

1. Checkout the
   [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/wordpress/openverse-infrastructure)
   and bump the catalog version with the `just bump prod catalog-airflow`
   command.
1. Once you've verified that no DAGs are running, update the value of
   `running_dags_cleared` to `true` in the
   [production module declaration](https://github.com/WordPress/openverse-infrastructure/blob/27c41ede9b24991909194e0a6477f6b11fceac0c/environments/prod/catalog-airflow.tf#L33).
1. `just apply prod catalog-airflow` and verify the plan before deploying.
1. Restore the value of `running_dags_cleared` back to `false`.

## Post-deployment steps

1. Check for any Sentry errors in the maintainer's `#openverse-alerts` channel,
   or in the Sentry UI.
1. Ensure that Airflow is accessible at <https://airflow.openverse.engineering>.
1. If an Airflow version upgrade was deployed, ensure that the version is
   correct in the Airflow UI (bottom left of the footer on any page).
1. Review and Approve the automatically-generated changelog pull request in the
   repository.
1. Push up a PR to the infrastructure repository with the Terraform changes you
   pushed (the version bump for the relevant module).
1. In the event of errors or problems, repeat the deployment process using the
   latest stable version of the application. You can find the release version
   number in the [changelogs](/changelogs/index), and then the tag to pass to
   the action is the version number prefixed with "rel-", for example
   "rel-2023.07.03.17.52.00".
1. If anything else goes wrong or service is disrupted, consider this a
   Production Incident and notify the team.
