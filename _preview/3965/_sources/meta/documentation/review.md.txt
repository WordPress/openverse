# Documentation proofreading and review

Historically the Openverse project has occasionally done a "documentation bug
bash" where maintainers sat down together to read through our existing
documentation and identify potential issues or necessary changes. While this
should happen in a concerted, maintainer-wide effort at least once a year, we
can also individually perform some aspect of this on an ongoing basis.

## What to look for

When proofreading a particular documentation page, consider the following:

- Who is the audience? Is the document accessible to that audience in tone,
  language, and location?
- What is the purpose? Is the document's purpose clear and does the document
  fulfill that purpose?
- What is the scope? Does the document sufficiently cover its intended scope?
  Are there aspects missing? Are there spurious aspects that could be broken
  into separate documents? On the other hand, are there pages that should be
  combined or more clearly linked, whether in text or via organisation, in order
  to fully cover the intended scope?
- Does it work[^dog-fooding]? If the document is a guide, try out the steps for
  yourself and confirm that they work. Are there gaps in the steps that can be
  explicitly documented? Can any steps be simplified? Is there spurious
  information that could be moved into supplementary documentation, especially
  information that unnecessarily complicates the guide?

If you identify discrepancies in any of these areas, open an issue. If possible,
suggest an edit that would fix or improve the situation.

Additionally, we should look for opportunities to document currently
undocumented parts of the project. If you notice these, open issues to request
the documentation.

[^dog-fooding]:
    This process of trying something we've built or written out for ourselves is
    also sometimes called "dog fooding".

<!-- TODO: Figure out a way to document the last time a documentation page was reviewed by a maintainer to make it easier for folks to review pages that most need it (i.e., ones that haven't recently been reviewed) -->
