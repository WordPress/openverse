# Openverse API Terms of Service

_Effective as of 5 May 2022_

## 1. Your Agreement to the Terms

Thank you for using the Openverse Catalog application programming interface
(“Openverse API”). BY USING THE OPENVERSE API, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE
READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THESE API TERMS OF USE (hereafter,
“API Terms”). By using the Openverse API, you also represent that you have the
legal authority to accept the API Terms on behalf of yourself and any party you
represent in connection with your use of the Openverse API. If you do not agree
to the API Terms, you are not authorized to use the Openverse API.

## 2. Licensed Uses and Restrictions

In connection with your use of the Openverse API:

- You must adhere to all rate limits, registration requirements, and comply with
  all requirements in the Openverse API documentation;
- You must not scrape the content in the Openverse Catalog;
- You must not use multiple machines to circumvent rate limits or otherwise take
  measures to bypass our technical or security measures;
- You must not operate in a way that negatively affects other users of the API
  or impedes the WordPress Foundation's ability to provide its services;
- You must respect and comply with the terms and conditions applicable to the
  content and metadata accessible through the Openverse API, including by
  providing proper attribution to
  [CC-licensed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) works and respecting the
  terms and conditions of platforms hosting CC-licensed works.
- You must not, and the products you develop must not, encourage others to
  violate any laws, regulations, or rights of any other person or entity,
  including intellectual property rights.

## 3. Content and Data Available through the API

The Openverse API aggregates metadata about openly licensed content hosted on
websites managed by third parties. Openverse does not own or control the content
or data made available through the API, and does not verify its licensing status
or make any representations or warranties about the content or data whatsoever.
You are responsible for independently verifying whether you have the right to
use the content and data and what terms and conditions apply to your use.

## 4. Openverse Trademark Use

If you develop an application or other product or service using the Openverse
API, you must prominently indicate that it was made using the Openverse API but
is not endorsed or certified by Openverse. You must comply with the
[WordPress Foundation Trademark Policy](https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/)
for all use of the Openverse/WordPress logos and other trademarks.

## 5. Fees

To help ensure the sustainability of the Openverse project, Openverse reserves
the right to charge fees for commercial uses of the Openverse API and/or for
heavy usage that places more of a burden on the financial supporters of the
WordPress Foundation and the maintainers of its systems.

## 6. Changes to the Terms

Openverse is actively developing its product vision and strategy and may limit
access to, and/or change the terms that apply to, the Openverse API at any time
as plans take shape. If we make changes that we feel are material, we will make
reasonable efforts to update developers who we know are actively using the
Openverse API. Your continued use of the Openverse API after new and/or revised
API Terms are effective indications that you have read, understood, and agreed
to those terms.

## 7. Termination

Openverse may modify, suspend, or terminate the operation of, or access to, the
Openverse API at any time for any reason. Additionally, your individual access
to, and use of, the Openverse API may be terminated by Openverse at any time and
for any reason.
