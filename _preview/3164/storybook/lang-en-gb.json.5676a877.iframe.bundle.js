However, such metadata is still scanned for sensitive terms and is not treated as a special case. If {openverse}’s text scanning finds sensitive terms in those metadata fields for a work, the work will still receive a sensitivity designation based on sensitive text even though the sensitive text itself is not available through {openverse}. {openverse} takes the approach that sensitive textual content in a description is a relatively high correlative indicator of potentially sensitive works. As above, {openverse} understands that this is not perfect.","imperfect":"\\"{sectionName}\\" section","sensitiveTermsList":"sensitive terms list","description":"{openverse} scans some of the textual metadata related to works as provided by our sources for sensitive terms. {openverse}’s {sensitiveTermsList} is open source and contributions and input from the community are welcome and invited. Examples of potentially sensitive text include but are not limited to text of a sexual, biological, violent, racist, or otherwise derogatory nature. The project recognises that this approach is imperfect and that some works may inadvertently receive a sensitivity designation without necessarily being sensitive.

An individual work’s page includes the ability to report content as sensitive (or to report rights violations). {openverse} moderators check these reports and make decisions about whether to add a sensitivity designation to the work or, in certain cases as described above, delist the work from {openverse}’s services.","title":"User reported sensitivity"},"description":"{openverse} designates sensitive content in the API and on the {openverse}.org website using two methods: reports from {openverse} users and automated sensitive textual content detection.

This means that some content is designated \\"sensitive\\" that would not fall into a category of what is generally understood to be \\"mature\\" content (in other words, content specifically for an adult audience). The designation does not, however, imply that {openverse} or its maintainers view the content as inappropriate for the platform in general and is likewise not an implication of moral or ethical judgement.

In adherence to {wpCoc} and its {deiStatement}, {openverse} holds contributors to high expectations regarding conduct towards other contributors, the accessibility of contribution and the services, and, therefore, being an inclusive project. Similarly, {openverse} holds the expectation that the results returned from the API or displayed on the {openverse}.org website should be accessible by default. Everyone, regardless of background, should feel safe and included in {openverse}, whether they are a contributor to the technical aspects of the {openverse} services, a creator whose works are included in {openverse}, or an {openverse} user. {openverse} recognises its responsibility as a tool used by people of a wide variety of ages, including young people in educational settings, and pays particular attention to minimising accidental interaction with or exposure to sensitive content."},"title":"Sensitive content"},"collection":{"link":{"creator":"Open creator page","source":"Open source site"}},"unknownError":{"heading":"Whoops, it looks like something went wrong.
