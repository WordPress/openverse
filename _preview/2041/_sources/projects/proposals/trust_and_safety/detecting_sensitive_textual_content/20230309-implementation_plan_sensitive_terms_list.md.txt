The Openverse project
[Filter and blur sensitive results by term matching #377](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/70?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc&pane=issue&itemId=19530115)
requires that we compare the textual contents of Openverse media against a list
of sensitive terms. We use this list to identify media that should be marked as
"sensitive," which means they should not be displayed to users by default, but
only with their explicit consent. Importantly, this list is not used to censor
or deny access to specific works, but to enable opt-in access.

The list must be accessible to contributors who need to modify it, but not so
public that it could be seen by users who would rather not be exposed to it. We
recognize that the list itself is sensitive content, and it needs to be treated
with care.

To create and manage this list I recommend the following guidelines.

## Proposal

The Openverse team will maintain a standalone public repository which contains
an English-language list of sensitive terms. This term list is a living document
which accepts community revisions for adding and removing new terms. The
contents of the list will initially be based on an existing public list,
modified at the discretion of Openverse maintainers interested in contributing.
The list will be iterated on and refined as we develop community standards
around what constitutes "sensitive content" for Openverse users.

### Maintenance of the list

The list be will be maintained by a subset of Openeverse contributors who are
comfortable reading these strings, but also making judgments about which should
be included. This work may involve fielding pull requests and feedback from the
community, along with researching unfamiliar sensitive terms to determine their
suitability. Issues and PRs in this repo should be handled using the same
practices as our other repositories, in terms of response times, review
practices, and prioritization.

These issues should **not**, however be included in the Openverse project board
or directly referenced (linked to) in meetings. We want to take great care to
make sure folks are only seeing this content if they consent to. The management
of this list is itself a great model for how we want users of Openverse to view
sensitive content.

Participation in this group will be entirely opt-in. I (@zackkrida) will always
be part of the group.

#### How new terms are added

New terms will be added manually by community contributors or maintainers. We
don't have any specific quotas or goals to add new terms, but welcome them when
suggested.

In the future, it's possible we could use some analysis of Openverse content
reports to find identify new terms are users are being exposed to inadvertently.

### Anticipated questions

1.  Why is the list in a standalone repository, instead of the
    https://github.com/wordPress/openverse?

    The main reason to keep the list seperate is contributor safety. The list is
    kept independently from the codebase so that users must explicitly consent
    to viewing and downloading it. Additionally, there are Search Engine
    Optimization and blocklist considerations with public GitHub repositories.

    We do not, for example, want students to be unable to access our repository
    and contribute to it because it is blocked by a school administration's web
    filter.

2.  Why is the list only in English?

    At the time of writing Openverse doesn't do any translation of the textual
    contents of indexed media. We also do not translate user-submitted searches.
    The vast majority of indexed works are in English. Additionally, it would be
    difficult to validate suggestions for terms in languages not spoken by
    Openverse maintainers, which to my current knowledge includes English,
    Spanish, Brazilian Portugese, Turkish, and Russian. English is the only
    language used by all maintainers.

3.  On what basis will Openverse maintainers use their "discretion" to create
    this list?

    Until our community has developed its own standards around sensitivity, we
    can use a few existing documents in the WordPress and user-submitted content
    ecosystem to guide us:

    - WordPress's page on [etiquette](https://wordpress.org/about/etiquette/) in
      the project.
    - WordPress's
      [code of conduct](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/)
      for in-person events.
    - YouTube's
      [community guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/)
      offers a decent list of categories for unacceptable types of content. For
      example, their
      [thumbnail policy](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9229980?hl=en&ref_topic=9282679#zippy=%2Cage-restricted-thumbnails-and-thumbnail-removal)
      includes some information on types of sexual and violent content that
      either can't be used or can be used behind a flag comparable to ours.
      - Additionally, please read
        [#this-will-not-be-perfect](#this-will-not-be-perfect).

## Implementation Plan

1. Ping a WordPress GitHub account maintainer to request that they create the
   `WordPress/openverse-sensitive-terms` repository.
2. Initialize the repository with a `README.md` and a blank
   `sensitive-terms.txt` file.
3. Create a PR which initializes the sensitive terms list by copying all terms
   from two existing lists and removing any duplicates (Note: _I am not
   including the links here to prevent accidental viewing of the repository, but
   they should be easily found by searching their names._):

   - LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words
   - surge-ai/profanity

   These combined lists give us a total of 1913 terms. This PR should be
   reviewed by the sensitive list maintainers to remove any unacceptable words
   based on their discretion (see above for more on that).

4. Identify willing reviewers from the `@WordPress/openverse-maintainers` group
   who are comfortable with looking at the list and reviewing the PR, looking
   for terms which should be removed or missing terms which should be added.
5. Merge the PR, and now the list is available for use in Openverse projects.
6. Publish a "Make" post about the creation of the list and its purpose.
7. The sensitive term list can be included as an environment variable in any of
   our repositories by adding a terraform `http` data source. The code would
   look something like this:

   ```terraform
   data "http" "sensitive-terms-raw" {
     # Example of the raw url we would fetch from the repo
     url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WordPress/openverse-sensitive-terms/main//sensitive_terms.txt"
   }

   locals {
      # The `sensitive()` function makes sure this list isn't printed by terraform
      sensitive_terms_list = sensitive([for line in split("\n", data.http.sensitive-terms-raw): chomp(line)])
   }
   ```

   `locals.sensitive_terms_list` can then be supplied to any of our terraform
   modules.

## This will not be perfect

By default, we accept that this list and its usage will not be perfect. At times
we may accidentally include terms which inadvertently cause harm to groups or
individuals. We may also accidentally expose users to undesired content in the
implementation of this list. Despite the potential for these transgressions this
work will always be based on the following assumptions:

1. Safety first. Given the choice, we would prefer to incorrectly restrict
   non-sensitive content rather than accidentally show sensitive content.
2. Avoid censorship. This list will not be used to block or deny access to
   content, rather to make the viewing of content opt-in. The Openverse project
   will use other means to explicitly block or remove content. Removing
   sensitive content can, in many cases, be its own form of harm. A quote From
   the research paper "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models
   Be Too Big? ü¶ú"[1] illustrates this well:

   ‚ÄúIf we filter out the discourse of marginalized populations, we fail to
   provide training data that reclaims slurs and otherwise describes
   marginalized identities in a positive light‚Äù

3. Encourage feedback. We will request and monitor community feedback on the
   terms in this list (without inadvertently exposing anyone to the list) to
   make sure it meets the expectations of our users.

## Guidelines for using the list in Openverse projects

1. Never use terms from the list in Openverse repositories (issues, discussions,
   or code itself), chats, or communications of any time, outside of the
   sensitive terms repository.
2. Do not link directly to the list file itself; always reference the
   repository. The README will provide important context towards consenting to
   viewing the list.
3. Always use the most up-to-date version of the sensitive terms list when
   filtering and marking media as sensitive in Openverse projects.

## How the initial sensitive terms list was chosen

The initial set of terms, created by combining two lists:

- LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words
  - Very popular, used by many FOSS projects
  - Created explicitly for stock photography moderation
- surge-ai/profanity
  - Comprehensive
  - Contains more racist terms than LDNOOBW
  - Is categorized, which we're not using yet but could in the future

Generally, it is beneficial to us that our list be as comprehensive as possible.
This actually speeds up the time required to evaluate all works for sensitivity.
It also makes sure we're correctly marking as many works as possible. An earlier
version of this proposal only used the LDNOOBW list which was good, but limited
in scope.

Other lists were considered and rejected for a few reasons:

- Even smaller datasets
- Poorly-maintained with ignored PRs for terms to be reconsidered

## Credits

Many of the term lists I evaluated in considering this work came from a
[Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-list-dirty-naughty-obscene-bad-words/)
entitled "AI and the List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words".
That article discusses the limits of this kind of text matching in-depth and is
an excellent read for anyone working on content safety in Openverse.
