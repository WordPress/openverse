# Openverse Decision-Making Process

This process is loosely based on the Sociocratic "consent decision-making"
model, but is heavily adapted for an asynchronous context. The purpose of this
process is to help contributors to the Openverse project make expedient
decisions. That is, decisions that are both "good enough for now" and also made
quickly. In many ways, this process is a refinement on what was already being
practised, but with clearer expectations about time and feedback expression.
