# Changelogs

These changelog files are automatically generated when maintainers run the
"Release app" workflow.

The lists of changes are derived using the "stack" labels and are organised by
type of change. The documents are generated using the
[`release-drafter`](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter)
workflow.
