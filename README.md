## About

Repository containing the [CC Search](https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/) frontend application. This web app contains all the UI which communicates with the [CC Search API](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-api) to get the data that is rendered in the browser.

CC Search is an interface to search for content that is licensed under Creative Commons licenses or in the public domain.

The frontend app is built using [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Getting Started

Run the following commands in order to have the code up and running on your machine:

```bash
# installs dependencies
$ npm install

# Builds and serves assets with hot-reload
$ npm run dev
```

### Docker setup

Alternatively, you can use Docker to build and run the application. You just have to run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You should now have the application running and accessible at http://localhost:8443.

You don't need to have the CC Search API running locally to be able to run the frontend application. It's configured to communicate, by default, with the [API](https://api.creativecommons.engineering) that's already publicly available. If you wish, you can change the URL of the API that's used during development at https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-frontend/blob/develop/config/.env#L5

## Running tests

You can run the tests by executing:

```bash
npm run test
```

## localhost tunneling

If you want to make your local development server accessible to the internet (for testing or showing someone something you're working on), you can use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/). Follow the documentation on the `ngrok` site to install it and set it up. Once you have it installed, get the development server for CC Search running and in a separate window/tab, run:

```
# The extra parameters are required to ensure that ngrok redirects to the HTTPS version of the site
# and that the host header matches one that is accepted by the server
# (ngrok's default hostname is randomly generated and is not whitelisted).
ngrok http http://localhost:8443 -host-header="localhost:8443"
```

If you need to run a HTTP version (for example, if you're testing against third-party websites that do not accept the self-signed cerificate generated by the dev server), run the dev server using `npm run dev` and use the following command to start `ngrok`:

```
ngrok http 8443 -host-header="localhost:8443"
```

## Code Standards

Code is linted with `eslint` and formatted with `prettier`. Linting and formatting will automatically run on precommit. You will need to fix any linting issues before comitting. We reccommend formatting your JavaScript files on save in your text editor. You can learn how to do this in Visual Studio Code [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode#format-on-save).

### Versioning

CC Search uses [CalVer](https://calver.org/) for version numbering, in the `YYYY.M.Micro` format. This format is intentionally compatiable with NPM's `semver` parser. `Micro` is bumped whenever there are multiple releases in a month, for example `2020.07.1` is the first release in July 2020, while `2020.07.2` is the second.

## Deployment

Details about how to deploy the frontend code can be found on the [CC Wiki](https://wikijs.creativecommons.org/tech/cc-search/frontend) (Accessible to CC Staff only).
