# Keeping this as a separate Dockerfile prevents the need to rely on additional
# contexts required for the frontend build (namely, `repo_root`). These are
# possible with compose as of https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/10369
# and do appear to work, but it increases the complexity and these features
# are not yet all available in every containerd implementation or distribution
# (Debian, for example, still distributes an older version of compose without
# this new feature). For the sake of keeping the local setup simpler and not
# requiring contributors to have bleeding-edge Docker and compose plugin versions,
# we can simply use a separate file for the time being. Once/if we start to use
# nginx to serve static files for the frontend, we will need to integrate this
# target into the shared Dockerfile.
