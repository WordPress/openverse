Openverse development toolkit

USAGE
  ov <subcommand> [...ARGS]

COMMANDS
  ov [help|--help|-h]
    Show this documentation and exit.

  ov init
    Initialise the Openverse development toolkit for the first time
    Alias for:

        ov build && ov setup-env && ov just install-hooks && ov just init-ov-aliases

  ov build [...ARGS]
    Build the Openverse development toolkit Docker image.
    ARGS are passed to `docker build`. See `docker build --help` for options.

  ov setup-env
    Setup the environment inside the container. `ov init` automatically runs this,
    and in most cases you should not need to run this manually. However, you may
    occasionally need to run it manually if tool requirements inside the container
    change. This can also be a helpful debugging step if tools in the container are
    not working as expected.

  ov stop
    Stop the persistent `ov` Docker container.

  ov clean
    Remove the Openverse development toolkit Docker container, image and volume.
    Use in conjunction with `ov init` to recreate the environment from
    scratch:

        ov clean && ov init

    Warning: running `ov clean` will result in needing to fully rebuild the environment
    including downloading tools handled by `ov setup-env` and pre-commit environments.

  ov hook HOOK
    Run Git hooks through pre-commit inside the development toolkit container

  ov COMMAND [...ARGS]
    Run COMMAND inside the development toolkit container
    Hints: The toolkit comes loaded with many tools for working with Openverse! Try
    some of the following:

      - ov just
      - ov pdm
      - ov pnpm
      - ov python
      - ov bash
EOF

  exit 0
