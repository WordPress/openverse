Openverse development toolkit

USAGE
  ov <subcommand> [...ARGS]

COMMANDS
  ov init
    Initialise the Openverse development toolkit for the first time
    Alias for:

        ov build && ov setup-env && ov just install-hooks && ov just init-ov-profile

  ov build [...ARGS]
    Build the Openverse development toolkit Docker image.
    ARGS are passed to `docker build`. See `docker build --help` for options.

  ov setup-env
    Setup the environment inside the container. `ov init` automatically runs this,
    and in most cases you should not need to run this manually. However, you may
    occasionally need to run it manually if tool requirements inside the container
    change. This can also be a helpful debugging step if tools in the container are
    not working as expected.

  ov stop
    Stop the persistent `ov` Docker container.

  ov doctor
    Try some basic automated troubleshooting steps for common issues.

  ov clean
    Remove the Openverse development toolkit Docker container, image and volume.
    Use in conjunction with `ov init` to recreate the environment from
    scratch:

        ov clean && ov init

    Warning: running `ov clean` will result in needing to fully rebuild the environment
    including downloading tools handled by `ov setup-env` and pre-commit environments.

  ov hook HOOK
    Run Git hooks through pre-commit inside the development toolkit container.

  ov aliases [--help|-h]
    Display information about ov aliases. By default, lists all available aliases.
    Passing --help will print documentation about how to use and configure aliases.

  ov COMMAND [...ARGS]
    Run COMMAND inside the development toolkit container. COMMAND will be processed
    through ov aliases (see `ov aliases --help` for details). ov is aware of your
    current working directory and will execute the command relative to your current directory
    inside the repository.

    Tip: The toolkit comes loaded with many tools for working with Openverse! Try
    some of the following:

      - ov just
      - ov pdm
      - ov pnpm
      - ov python
      - ov bash
      - ov jq
      - ov http
