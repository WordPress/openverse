# Create filtered index DAG factory

This module creates the filtered index creation DAGs for each media type
using a factory function.

Filtered index creation is handled by the ingestion server. The DAGs generated
by the ``build_create_filtered_index_dag`` function in this module are
responsible for triggering the ingestion server action to create and populate
the filtered index for a given media type. The DAG awaits the completion
of the filtered index creation and then points the filtered index alias for the
media type to the newly created index.

## When this DAG runs

The DAGs generated in this module are triggered by the data refresh DAGs.
Maintaining this process separate from the data refresh DAGs, while still
triggering it there, allows us to run filtered index creation independently
of the full data refresh. This is primarily useful in two cases: for testing
changes to the filtered index creation; and for re-running filtered index
creation if an urgent change to the sensitive terms calls for an immediate
recreation of the filtered indexes.

## Race conditions

Because filtered index creation employs the ``reindex`` Elasticsearch API
to derive the filtered index from an existing index, we need to be mindful
of the race condition that potentially exists between the data refresh DAG
and this DAG. The race condition is caused by the fact that the data refresh
DAG always deletes the previous index once the new index for the media type
is finished being created. Consider the situation where filtered index creation
is triggered to run during a data refresh. The filtered index is being derived
from the previous index for the media type. Once the data refresh is finished,
it will delete that index, causing the reindex to halt because suddenly it has
no data source from which to pull documents.

There are two mechanisms that prevent this from happening:

1. The filtered index creation DAGs are not allowed to run if a data refresh
for the media type is already running.
2. The data refresh DAGs will wait for any pre-existing filtered index creation
DAG runs for the media type to finish before continuing.

This ensures that neither are depending on or modifying the origin indexes
critical for the creation of the filtered indexes.

Because the data refresh DAG triggers the filtered index creation DAG, we do
allow a ``force`` param to be passed to the DAGs generated by this module.
This parameter is only for use by the data refresh DAG and should not be
used when manually triggering the DAG unless you are absolutely certain
of what you are doing.
