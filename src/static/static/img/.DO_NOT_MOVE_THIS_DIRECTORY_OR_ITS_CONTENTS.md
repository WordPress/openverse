# DO NOT MOVE THIS DIRECTORY OR ITS CONTENTS

As the title says, don't do it 😁

For historical reasons (pre-Openverse, back in the CC Search days) we need to serve these files at `/static/img/*.svg`. Nuxt serves static files at the top level, so anything immediately inside the `src/static` directory will just be served directly at `/` (like `/favicon.ico`). The nested `static` directories are absolutely necessary to maintain existing static assets being served at the root _and_ these historical static assets that need to be served at `/static`.

If you do happen to move these files you will break the references to these glyphs in the attribution HTML copied users from single result pages throughout the entire history of CC Search and Openverse.

Thank you for not moving or renaming these files ❤️
